                            Gozleme is a flatbread with a savory filling. It requires a lot of mastery to roll the dough to its required thinness to make the tastiest and crispiest gozleme.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is a popular Turkish street food and a special part of the delicious Turkish breakfast. It can be filled with various fillings such as mashed potatoes, cheese and parsley, spinach and cheese, ground meat and onions. Gozleme goes very well with a glass
                            of cay (Turkish black tea) or ayran, traditional Turkish yogurt drink.

                            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>3 cups plain flour</li>
                                <li>1 sachet instant dried yeast</li>
                                <li>Pinch of salt</li>
                                <li>3 tbsp. olive oil</li>
                                <li>2 tbsp. plain natural yoghurt</li>
                                <li>260 ml / 1/5 cups warm water</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>For the filling:</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>200 g baby spinach leaves</li>
                                <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
                                <li>1 tsp. red pepper flakes</li>
                                <li>230 g feta cheese</li>
                                <li>1 tbsp. olive oil</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>Preparation</h3>
                            <p>
                                Combine about 150 ml warm water, the yeast, and salt in a small bowl, stir and cover. Stand in a warm place for 5 minutes or until bubbles form on the surface. Sift the flour into a large bowl. Make a well in the middle and pour in the yeast, water &
                                salt mixture, olive oil, yoğurt, and the remaining warm water (about 110 ml).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Using your hand, draw in the flour from the sides and work the mixture into a dough. Knead thoroughly to form a soft dough. Divide the dough into 5 pieces, knead them, and roll into balls. Place the balls on a floured surface, cover with a damp cloth,
                                and leave them to rest for about 30 minutes, or until the dough doubles in size.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Meanwhile, prepare the filling. Chop the washed spinach leaves thoroughly. Knead the onions, spinach, olive oil, and red pepper flakes (optional) with your hands for a few minutes. Stir in the feta cheese and combine well.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On a lightly floured surface, roll out each of the balls of the dough with a rolling pin into thin, flat rounds, about 40 cm diameter. Sprinkle a little flour as you roll the dough so that the dough won’t stick. Roll until you achieve a thin flat sheet
                                of dough.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Fold the left and right sides of the dough in a way for the edges to meet in the middle. Spread about 2½ tablespoon filling into the middle part of this flat sheet. Then fold the top and bottom edges over the filling, making sure all the filling is safely
                                covered. Press edges together well to seal. Repeat the same procedure for the rest of the dough balls.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Heat a griddle or a non-stick pan, and brush one side of the gözleme with a little olive oil and place on the pan to cook for about 2 -3 minutes, or until golden brown. Brush the uncooked side with a little olive oil and then flip it over. Cook for another
                                2-3 minutes, until golden brown. Brush both cooked sides of gözleme with a little olive oil - this will keep the gözleme moist. Cook the rest of the gözleme the same way.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You can either roll the gözleme to serve or you can cut in halves or quarters.

                                <li>1 cup water</li>
                                <li>1 bunch or 1/2 cup parsley, finely chopped</li>
                                <li>1 tbsp. olive oil</li>
                                <li>
                                    3-4 tbsp. olive oil (or vegetable oil) for shallow frying
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    6 thin slices of tomato and green bell peppers, seeded – for decorative topping
                                </li>
                                <li>1-2 tsp. red pepper flakes</li>
                                <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>Preparation</h3>
                            <p>Preheat oven to 180 °C.</p>
                            <p>
                                Cut the eggplants in half lengthways leaving the stalk intact. In each half of eggplant, cut a deep split lengthways without cutting through to the skin on the opposite side and leaving 13 mm uncut at either end. Sprinkle salt over the flesh side of the
                                eggplants and leave them aside for 15 minutes. Salt will help the moisture come out of the eggplants.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In a little of the olive oil, sauté the onions until soft. Add the ground lamb and cook until all the moisture is absorbed. Add the garlic, chopped tomatoes, tomato paste, and red pepper flakes. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, mix well.
                                Continue cooking for a further couple of minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in most of the chopped parsley. Seasoning is important, so please check the seasoning of the mixture and add more salt or pepper according
                                to taste.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Dry the eggplants with kitchen towel thoroughly. Lightly brown them evenly on both sides in the olive oil (or vegetable oil). With the split sides facing up, place them into a well-oiled ovenproof dish or a baking tray. Spoon the filling into the splits.
                                On the top of each filled eggplant put a slice of tomato and a green bell pepper. Mix the water with a drizzle of olive oil. Pour this mixture on the baking tray. Cover and bake in the preheated oven for about 45 minutes.
                                Remove the cover and continue baking for another 15 minutes or until they are tender, and the eggplants are nicely browned on top.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Serve hot with plain rice and a dollop of plain yoğurt by the side.

                            Sarma refers to a dish that can be prepared with grape, cabbage, or chard leaves. The term sarma derives from Turkish verb "sarmak, " which means to wrap or to roll. It can be prepared with rice and spices (vegetarian), or with rice and ground meat. Both
                            are delicious. Sometimes sarma is called dolma, too, yet on the western part of Türkiye, rolled leaves are always called sarma.

                            <h3>Preparation</h3>
                            <p>
                                If you have fresh grape leaves, boil water in a pot. Cook the grape leaves for about 1 minute in boiling water. Take out and let cool. If you are using jarred grape leaves in brine, soak them in cold water for an hour as they tend to be salty.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Place the ground meat, rice, onion, black pepper, salt, parsley, dill, and 1.5 tbsp. olive oil in a bowl. Dissolve 1 tbsp. tomato paste with 3 tbsp. hot water and pour this into the bowl. Mix all the ingredients.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Save the broken, faulty leaves. Use them to cover the bottom of a pot with grape leaves to prevent the stuffed ones from burning.
                            </p>

                                Take a leaf. Place it on a smooth surface the vein side up/shiny side down. Place a spoonful of the stuffing at the bottom center of the leaf, close to the stem. Fold in two sides first and then the bottom. Then roll it neatly like a cigar. Keep rolling
                                until all the leaves are finished. If you still have stuffing, you can use it to stuff small bell peppers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Stack stuffed grape leaves in the pot tightly layer by layer. Add 1.5 tbsp. olive oil or butter, the juice of half lemon, and water to barely cover the sarmas. Place a flat plate on top of the stuffed grape leaves so that they won't move while cooking.
                                Cover and cook on low heat for 35-45 minutes.

                                <li>1 cup of ground walnuts</li>

                            <h3>Preparation</h3>
                            <p>
                                Put the pumpkin slices side by side in a steel pot and cover with the sugar. Place the lid on the pot and let it rest in room temperature at least 4 hours (or overnight if possible) for the pumpkin to release its liquid and melt the sugar. The next day,
                                add the clove and the cinnamon stick and cook the pumpkin on low heat for about 50-55 minutes until it has softened and the syrup is thicker. Place the pumpkin on serving plates, pour the remaining syrup on top, top with
                                a generous serving of kaymak and sprinkle with walnuts.
